                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prices of players are given based on the number of
                        points they are projected to deliver.So you need to

                    <p>
                        Points are awarded to players for goals, assists, saves

                        Players can also earn additional bonus points in Fantasy

                        Your team&apos;s points for the match round or
                        &quot;Gameweek&quot; will be scored by your starting XI.
                        But if a starting player does not feature for their club
                        in that round of matches, the points scored by the first
                        player on your bench will automatically be counted
                        instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same process occurs if two or three starting players
                        fail to appear.

                    <p>
                        You can also earn extra points by selecting a captain
                        from your starting line-up. The captain&apos;s points
                        are doubled in that Gameweek.
